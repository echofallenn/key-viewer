# WELCOME!
this is a key-viewer that i made with chatgpt's help
if there is any bugs, post it on issues or contact me on business.echofallenn@gmail.com
enjoy ;)


also:
## (may be a) common issue
"No config.ini file found. Go to https://github.com/echofallenn/key-viewer/ to troubleshoot."
fix:
create a config.ini file on the keyviewer directory and add this:
"[Settings]
key_size = 100
spacing = 20
num_keys = 4
highlight_color = 0,255,255,128
key_color = 255,255,255
text_color = 0,0,0
background_color = 0,0,0
keys = d,f,j,k" (without the "")
and change it for what you want!

done!
